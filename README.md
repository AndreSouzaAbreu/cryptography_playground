## USING SAGEMATH

Here are instructions for working specifically with sagemath.

First, install sagemath. Then, to use it within python (or sage itself):

```shell
sage --preparse <module>.sage     # will generate a file called <module>.sage.py
mv <module>.sage.py <module>.py   # rename the file to be importable
```

Now, you just have to import it as a normal python module

```python
import <module>
```
